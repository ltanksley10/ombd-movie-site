# Current Weather Tracker

A static site built with Open Weather's API and React.

## Introduction

This site was built as more practice for using REST API's and React. Using Open
Weather's API the current temperature and weather description is rendered when
searching for a local city, state and country. Depending on the temperature a 
certain background image is displayed. I also added more weather data points for
better usability including, wind speed, humidity, and sunrise/sunset times.
